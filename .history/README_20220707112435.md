## Overview
### Description
Core: Our Environmentalism is an educational web app that provides people with information about different non-profit organizations focused on environmentalism in their area. The user is able to sign up and save different organizations so they can come back and learn more about them. 
Stretch: The app goes deeper, pulling from environmental data to visualize the amount of environmental pollutants in a certain area. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Educational
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for web applications and work optimally on laptop/desktops but it would still work on mobile devices. 
- **Story:** Provides users with a mapping tool to look at environmental data + non-profits to save in that area. 
- **Market:** This is primarilly geared towards Gen-Z and Milenials but anyone could use it. 
- **Habit:** This application would not be a daily use application, rather users would look at it when they are feeling inspired to support climate justice. 
- **Scope:** At it's core, the application is just providing information about environmental justice & different organizations people can connect to to take action. However, this could expand to have more interactivity, with nonprofits posting certain events.
